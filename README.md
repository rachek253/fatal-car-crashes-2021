This repository focuses on investigationg the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data for 2021. This data contains information on fatal car 
accidents that occurred in the United States in 2021. The purpose of this project was to investigate whether or not there was any relationship between weather patterns, road conditions, geographical location (rural 
versus urban areas), county, and time of year with the number of fatal accidents in 2021. 

This was my final project from my Fall 2023 DS 150: Introduction to Data Science course, where the intention was to showcase my knowledge of one machine learning algorthim that I had learned over the course of the 
semester. I performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset and created a decision tree classifier algorithm to predict the number of fatalities in car accidents. This repository contains the code for this project as well as the report I submitted as well.
